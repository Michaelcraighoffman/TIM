1.0 Basic Information

	Checkers 68k is a clone of the ever-popular checkers game. If
	you don't know what checkers is, you must be living in a very
	isolated place. Anyway, checkers is a game of skill involving
	two people. The object of the game is to get all of the other
	persons checkers removed from the board. You do this by
	manuevering your own checkers into strategic positions, in
	order to jump over an opponents piece. When all your opponents
	pieces have been jumped, you win, and vice versa, if all your
	pieces get jumped, you lose. Pretty simple, no?

	Well anyway, this game is an electronic version of Checkers.
	The sprites are notoriously bad, but that's because I'm not a
	graphics artist and had to shrink these down from 66x66 sprites
	on my computer to 16x10 on the calculator. If you know how to
	do grayscale sprites and want to help me out, I'll be glad to
	stick your name in here. :-)

	This program supports three types of play. On-calc two player
	in which each player takes turns using the same calculator,
	red (white as it looks) goes first, then black. This is
	probably not the ideal way to play the game, but it's the
	easiest, most hassle-free and cheapest way (don't need two
	calculators). The second method is to play against the
	computer. The computer is always black. The third method is to
	use two calculators with the game on it, and use the link cable
	to play one against another. This is probably the most fun, but
	definitely the hardest one to work with, especially if you're
	trying to play in math class. ;-)

	The game will work on a TI-89 or TI-92+, and you can do link
	play between a TI-89 and a TI-92+, if you have those calcs.
	The program is the same on both calculators. I only have a
	TI-89, so there may be unknown issues with TI-92+ calcs since
	I can't test it on a real calculator. Though I do nearly 95% of
	my testing using VTI anyway. I generally only test speed and
	play control with real calculators.

	If you want more general information on Checkers, or information
	about any of the rules, all of the rules and information used in
	the creation of this game came from this site:

3.0 Gameplay Information

	From the home screen, send the program to the calculator. Run the
	program by typing checkers() and pressing ENTER. From the main
	intro screen, press ENTER to start the game, or use the other
	menu options to change the game options. By default, the game
	will start in 2 player on-calc mode.

	The game is fairly simple to play. Red moves first (the red pieces
	look white, but they actually come from a red checker). To move,
	use the arrow keys to find the piece. A highlighted square will
	show you where you are. Press ENTER to select a piece, then move
	the highlighted square (it has a different color when you're moving,
	rather than when you are just selecting which piece to move) to the
	position you wish to move into. Red checkers move diagonally forward
	(up the screen). You will not be allowed to make illegal moves. If you
	try to make an illegal move, an error message will be displayed.

	To jump, select the square diagonally behind the opponents piece you
	wish to jump. If you are doing a multi-jump move, you will need to
	do the jumps one-by-one, so make the first jump, then it will display
	a message saying "Multi Jump" which lets you know you have a multi-jump
	opportunity. You must jump if you can, and you must complete all
	multi-jumps, if you begin one. If you have a choice of several jumps,
	you may make whichever one you want. If you attempt to make a move when
	you have a jump available, the program will display a "Must Jump" message
	and highlight the first jump opportunity it finds. There may be other
	jump opportunities as well, but only the first one will be highlighted.

	Black moves second, and the rules behave the same way. Black checkers
	move diagonally downward (down the screen). If you selected vs. Computer
	mode from the intro screen, the computer will play the black side. It will
	not use the selection system, but rather simply move a piece and return
	control to you. As the checkers AI is very simple, it shouldn't take any
	noticable amount of time to make its move.

	If any piece is advanced to the eigth rank (i.e. you get a checker
	all the way across the board), it attains the rank of King Checker. Kings
	have the ability to move both forward and backward, but a king can still
	be jumped by a normal piece, or another king of course.

	When all the checkers of one side or another are gone, the side who still
	has checkers wins. If either side becomes unable to move (all their pieces
	are blocked), then that side loses. When one side loses the game, a message
	displaying the winner is printed at the top of the screen replacing the
	logo. You can press any key to exit the game after that.

	You cannot jump your own pieces, and you cannot make jumps that jump over
	two pieces. A jump is a diagonal move over a piece of the opposite color
	to the diagonal square directly behind the opposing piece. The game will not
	allow you to make illegal moves, and will alert you to such errors.

	Other Options:

		Pressing F1 during the game will save the current game. You
		can then load that game by pressing F2. There is only room
		for one save game, and it takes approximately 200 bytes of
		memory on the calculator. For more information, see the
		section on real-time state saving/loading.

		Pressing ESC will exit the game. If you quit a game without
		saving it, the game is lost, and cannot be retrieved. You
		will not be prompted to exit, so watch out for accidental
		ESC keypresses. State saving is disabled in link-play, but
		you may save your state in vs. computer mode or on-calc 2
		player. The computer will never attempt to save or load the
		game.

		In Link Play mode, if your calculator is not responding to
		link actions, and it appears locked up, press the ON key to
		abort the link mode and force-quit the game. Do not do this
		lightly though, because you will lose the current game if you
		abort the link, and will have to restart.

4.0 Real Time State Saving/Loading

	Checkers 68k has a unique feature. Real-time state saving. This
	means you can save your game at any time in the game, and it will
	be ready for you to reload at any time you choose. So, if you were
	almost sure about one move, and wanted to try it out, but wanted to
	see what might have happened if you'd done something different, you
	can save the game at that position, then load it back when you want
	to try something new.

	To save a game state, simply press the F1 key when playing a game.
	To load the game state, press the F2 key while playing.

	Only one game may be saved at a time, for simplicity, so you can't
	switch back and forth between two games unless you rename them by
	hand. The state file must be called chksaves (checker save state).
	You can delete it if you wish, but you will be unable to do state
	saving if you archive it. However, you should still be able to
	load the state.

	If the load or save fails for some reason, a message will be
	displayed across the right hand part of the screen. Conversely, if
	the load/save is a success, that message will be displayed instead.

	State Loading/Saving is disabled when link play is enabled. It
	has the potential to cause instability if both sides don't load the
	exact same data. I may try to implement this in the future.

5.0 Link Play Information

	To do link play, you will need two calculators. It does not matter
	if they are TI-89's or TI-92+'s, or one of each. You must transfer
	the program to both calculators and run the program on both
	calculators.

	First decide which side is going to play Red and which side will
	play Black. Red always goes first. When you have decided which side
	will play what color, start the program on both calculators. The link
	cable must be in both link ports before you start the game, or it
	may not work. This is just one of the nuances of link play.

	Okay, press the F1 key to select Link Play for the side you have
	chosen. If you both pick the same side, the link timer will time out
	and an error dialog will display. The timeout is 20 seconds, but if
	you accidentally chose incorrectly, press ON and the link will
	abort immediately.

	When you have picked Link Play for the side you want, press ENTER.
	The calculators will then send data to the other calculator on what
	kind of calculator they are using, so the program knows how to
	interpret the key presses (TI-92+ keyboard is slightly different
	from the TI-89 keyboard). Once the link has been establish, the
	game screen will show up.

	To play the game, simply play as you normally would. Red play goes
	first. The selections and moves of the player will display on
	both calculators, so you can see what the other person does, as
	they do it.

	If at any time, the link stops functioning, or the link cord is
	pulled out of either calculator, one or both of the calculators may
	appear to lock up. This is in fact not so. Rather, the calculator
	may simply be waiting for data that is never going to come. If this
	happens, press the ON button of the affected calculator. This will
	force-quit the link and the game. You might try alternatively to
	remove the link cable from both calcs and reinsert it. The second
	option may or may not work, and it has not been tested. If you
	press the ON button, the game is lost, and you will not be able to
	get back to that game, unless you remember all the moves you made.

6.0 Human vs. Computer Information

	To play against the computer, simply choose that option from the
	menu. When vs. Computer mode is selected, press ENTER to start
	the game. The player moves first, and is in control of the red
	pieces. Once you have made a move, the computer will analyze its
	moves and make the one it thinks is best. The AI is probably not
	the smartest computer on the block, but it's no dummy. I've
	played games against it where it actually managed to force me
	into a stalemate. (We both had a king left, and the AI isn't
	programmed to sacrifice himself if its avoidable). I hope it
	makes for fun gameplay without being impossible to beat.

	How does the AI work? Well, the code is not too complex (one of
	the smaller segments actually -- it's much harder to enforce the
	rules than to teach the computer to play within them). The AI
	is really not an AI at all. There is no strategy involved in the
	game at all. It makes the move it considers best for the current
	time.

	How does it know which move is best? Simple. The computer has a
	system of weights assigned to what will happen based on the move
	it makes. Multiple jumps are weighted highest. Then jumps, then
	regular moves. A move that will result in a multiple retaliation
	jump (i.e. I move, and you jump 2 or more pieces back) has the
	highest negative weight (i.e. this move is weighted less). Single
	retaliatory jumps are also weighted negatively, but not as much.
	Moves, jumps, and multiple jumps that result in king promotion
	are given bonus positive weights. The best move for the computer
	to make is the one that has the highest weight. This is not a
	good checkers strategy, but then again, it's not really an AI,
	as it does not think.

	Frequently Asked "AI" Questions:

	Q: Why does the computer seem to move the first piece when it has
	   many pieces it could move instead?

	A: This is actually not so. The game considers equal weights to be
	   no better than the other move, except when the randomness factor
	   comes in. Basically, 1/3 of the time, the computer will select
	   a move that is equal to its current best move as a "better" move,
	   although it is actually not. This gives the game a more "realistic"
	   feeling.

	Q: Did you base this system on any checker playing programs?

	A: No. First, they are far more complex than I wanted to implement,
	   second, it would have taken far longer to develop, and third,
	   I don't think its much fun playing against an almost unbeatable
	   opponent. When master player's lose to computer programs, then
	   it's clear that any average player will too.

	Q: If you wanted it to be beatable, but also good, why not have
	   a difficulty level for the computer?

	A: Well, that too takes lots of time, and I just don't feel like
	   the program will gain much from becomming a great player. It
	   was designed to reduce boredom, not to be an unsolvable
	   puzzle.

	Q: This AI sucks. Why can't you make a better one?

	A: If you think you can do better, by all means go ahead. I'll add
	   it to the official distribution if I think it's good. The source
	   code is freely available, you know. As for me, I don't have the
	   time or interest to pursue a great AI project right now.
